        <article>February 2015<br><br>One of the most valuable exercises
                you can try if you want to
                understand startups is to look at the most successful
                companies and
                explain why they were not as lame as they seemed when
                they first
                launched. Because they practically all seemed lame at
                first. Not
                just small, lame. Not just the first step up a big
                mountain. More
                like the first step into a swamp.<br><br>A Basic
                interpreter for the Altair? How could that ever grow
                into
                a giant company? People sleeping on airbeds in
                strangers' apartments?
                A web site for college students to stalk one another? A
                wimpy
                little single-board computer for hobbyists that used a
                TV as a
                monitor? A new search engine, when there were already
                about 10,
                and they were all trying to de-emphasize search? These
                ideas didn't
                just seem small. They seemed wrong. They were the kind
                of ideas
                you could not merely ignore, but ridicule.<br><br>Often
                the founders themselves didn't know why their ideas were
                promising. They were attracted to these ideas by
                instinct, because
                they were <a href="startupideas.html">living in the
                        future</a> and
                they sensed that something was missing. But they could
                not have
                put into words exactly how their ugly ducklings were
                going to grow
                into big, beautiful swans.<br><br>Most people's first
                impulse when they hear about a lame-sounding
                new startup idea is to make fun of it. Even a lot of
                people who
                should know better.<br><br>When I encounter a startup
                with a lame-sounding idea, I ask "What
                Microsoft is this the Altair Basic of?" Now it's a
                puzzle, and the
                burden is on me to solve it. Sometimes I can't think of
                an answer,
                especially when the idea is a made-up one. But it's
                remarkable how
                often there does turn out to be an answer. Often it's
                one the
                founders themselves hadn't seen
                yet.<br><br>Intriguingly, there are sometimes multiple
                answers. I talked to a
                startup a few days ago that could grow into 3 distinct
                Microsofts.
                They'd probably vary in size by orders of magnitude. But
                you can
                never predict how big a Microsoft is going to be, so in
                cases like
                that I encourage founders to follow whichever path is
                most immediately
                exciting to them. Their instincts got them this far. Why
                stop now?<br><br></article>

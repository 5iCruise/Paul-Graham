        <article>April 2009<br><br><i>Inc</i> recently asked me who I
                thought were the 5 most
                interesting startup founders of the last 30 years. How
                do
                you decide who's the most interesting? The best test
                seemed
                to be influence: who are the 5
                who've influenced me most? Who do I use as examples when
                I'm
                talking to companies we fund? Who do I find myself
                quoting?<br><br><b>1. Steve Jobs</b><br><br>I'd guess
                Steve is the most influential founder not just for me
                but
                for most people you could ask. A lot of startup culture
                is Apple
                culture. He was the original young founder. And while
                the concept
                of "insanely great" already existed in the arts, it was
                a novel
                idea to introduce into a company in the
                1980s.<br><br>More remarkable still, he's stayed
                interesting for 30 years. People
                await new Apple products the way they'd await new books
                by a popular
                novelist. Steve may not literally design them, but they
                wouldn't
                happen if he weren't CEO.<br><br>Steve is clever and
                driven, but so are a lot of people in the Valley.
                What makes him unique is his
                <a href="taste.html">sense of
                        design</a>. Before him, most
                companies treated design as a frivolous extra. Apple's
                competitors
                now know better.<br><br><b>2. TJ Rodgers</b><br><br>TJ
                Rodgers isn't as famous as Steve Jobs, but he may be the
                best
                writer among Silicon Valley CEOs. I've probably learned
                more from
                him about the startup way of thinking than from anyone
                else. Not
                so much from specific things he's written as by
                reconstructing the
                mind that produced them: brutally candid; aggressively
                garbage-collecting
                outdated ideas; and yet driven by pragmatism rather than
                ideology.<br><br>The first essay of his that I read was
                so electrifying that I
                remember exactly where I was at the time. It was
                <a href="http://www.cypress.com/?rID=34993">High
                        Technology Innovation: Free Markets or
                        Government Subsidies?</a> and
                I was downstairs in the Harvard Square T Station. It
                felt as if
                someone had flipped on a light switch inside my
                head.<br><br><b>3. Larry & Sergey</b><br><br>I'm sorry
                to treat Larry and Sergey as one person. I've always
                thought that was unfair to them. But it does seem as if
                Google was a
                collaboration.<br><br>Before Google, companies in
                Silicon Valley already knew it was
                important to have the best hackers. So they claimed, at
                least.
                But Google pushed this idea further than anyone had
                before. Their
                hypothesis seems to have been that, in the initial
                stages at least,
                <i>all</i> you need is good hackers: if you hire all the
                smartest people
                and put them to work on a problem where their success
                can be measured,
                you win. All the other stuff&mdash;which includes all
                the stuff that
                business schools think business consists of&mdash;you
                can figure out
                along the way. The results won't be perfect, but they'll
                be optimal.
                If this was their hypothesis, it's now been verified
                experimentally.<br><br><b>4. Paul
                        Buchheit</b><br><br>Few know this, but one
                person, Paul Buchheit, is responsible for
                three of the best things Google has done. He was the
                original
                author of GMail, which is the most impressive thing
                Google has after
                search. He also wrote the first prototype of AdSense,
                and was the
                author of Google's mantra "Don't be evil."<br><br>PB
                made a point in a talk once that I now mention to every
                startup
                we fund: that it's better, initially, to make a small
                number of
                users really love you than a large number kind of like
                you. If I
                could tell startups only
                <a href="13sentences.html">ten sentences</a>,
                this would be one of them.<br><br>Now he's cofounder of
                a startup called Friendfeed. It's only a
                year old, but already everyone in the Valley is watching
                them.
                Someone responsible for three of the biggest ideas at
                Google is
                going to come up with more.<br><br><b>5. Sam
                        Altman</b><br><br>I was told I shouldn't mention
                founders of YC-funded companies in
                this list. But Sam Altman can't be stopped by such
                flimsy rules.
                If he wants to be on this list, he's going to
                be.<br><br>Honestly, Sam is, along with Steve Jobs, the
                founder I refer to
                most when I'm advising startups. On questions of design,
                I ask
                "What would Steve do?" but on questions of strategy or
                ambition I
                ask "What would Sama do?"<br><br>What I learned from
                meeting Sama is that the doctrine of the elect
                applies to startups. It applies way less than most
                people think:
                startup investing does not consist of trying to pick
                winners the
                way you might in a horse race. But there are a few
                people with
                such force of will that they're going to get whatever
                they want.<br><br>

        <article>March 2021<br><br>I try to write using ordinary words
                and simple sentences.<br><br>That kind of writing is
                easier to read, and the easier something
                is to read, the more deeply readers will engage with it.
                The less
                energy they expend on your prose, the more they'll have
                left for
                your ideas.<br><br>And the further they'll read. Most
                readers' energy tends to flag
                part way through an article or essay. If the friction of
                reading
                is low enough, more keep going till the
                end.<br><br>There's an Italian dish called
                <i>saltimbocca</i>, which means "leap
                into the mouth." My goal when writing might be called
                <i>saltintesta</i>:
                the ideas leap into your head and you barely notice the
                words that
                got them there.<br><br>It's too much to hope that
                writing could ever be pure ideas. You
                might not even want it to be. But for most writers, most
                of the
                time, that's the goal to aim for. The gap between most
                writing and
                pure ideas is not filled with poetry.<br><br>Plus it's
                more considerate to write simply. When you write in a
                fancy way to impress people, you're making them do extra
                work just
                so you can seem cool. It's like trailing a long train
                behind you
                that readers have to carry.<br><br>And remember, if
                you're writing in English, that a lot of your
                readers won't be native English speakers. Their
                understanding of
                ideas may be way ahead of their understanding of
                English. So you
                can't assume that writing about a difficult topic means
                you can
                use difficult words.<br><br>Of course, fancy writing
                doesn't just conceal ideas. It can also
                conceal the lack of them. That's why some people write
                that way,
                to conceal the fact that they have
                <a
                        href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=hermeneutic+dialectics+hegemonic+modalities"><u></u></a>
                nothing to say. Whereas writing
                simply keeps you honest. If you say nothing simply, it
                will be
                obvious to everyone, including you.<br><br>Simple
                writing also lasts better. People reading your stuff in
                the
                future will be in much the same position as people from
                other
                countries reading it today. The culture and the language
                will have
                changed. It's not vain to care about that, any more than
                it's vain
                for a woodworker to build a chair to
                last.<br><br>Indeed, lasting is not merely an accidental
                quality of chairs, or
                writing. It's a sign you did a good job.<br><br>But
                although these are all real advantages of writing
                simply, none
                of them are why I do it. The main reason I write simply
                is that it
                offends me not to. When I write a sentence that seems
                too complicated,
                or that uses unnecessarily intellectual words, it
                doesn't seem fancy
                to me. It seems clumsy.<br><br>There are of course times
                when you want to use a complicated sentence
                or fancy word for effect. But you should never do it by
                accident.<br><br>The other reason my writing ends up
                being simple is the way I do
                it. I write the first draft fast, then spend days
                editing it, trying
                to get everything just right. Much of this editing is
                cutting, and
                that makes simple writing even simpler.<br><br>

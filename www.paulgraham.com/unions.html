        <article>May 2007<br><br>People who worry about the increasing
                gap between rich and poor
                generally look back on the mid twentieth century as a
                golden age.
                In those days we had a large number of high-paying union
                manufacturing
                jobs that boosted the median income. I wouldn't quite
                call the
                high-paying union job a myth, but I think people who
                dwell on it
                are reading too much into it.<br><br>Oddly enough, it
                was working with startups that made me realize
                where the high-paying union job came from. In a rapidly
                growing
                market, you don't worry too much about efficiency. It's
                more
                important to grow fast. If there's some mundane problem
                getting
                in your way, and there's a simple solution that's
                somewhat expensive,
                just take it and get on with more important things. EBay
                didn't
                win by paying less for servers than their
                competitors.<br><br>Difficult though it may be to
                imagine now, manufacturing was a
                growth industry in the mid twentieth century. This was
                an era when
                small firms making everything from cars to candy were
                getting
                consolidated into a new kind of corporation with
                national reach and
                huge economies of scale. You had to grow fast or die.
                Workers
                were for these companies what servers are for an
                Internet startup.
                A reliable supply was more important than low
                cost.<br><br>If you looked in the head of a 1950s auto
                executive, the attitude
                must have been: sure, give 'em whatever they ask for, so
                long as
                the new model isn't delayed.<br><br>In other words,
                those workers were not paid what their work was
                worth. Circumstances being what they were, companies
                would have
                been stupid to insist on paying them so
                little.<br><br>If you want a less controversial example
                of this phenomenon, ask
                anyone who worked as a consultant building web sites
                during the
                Internet Bubble. In the late nineties you could get paid
                huge sums
                of money for building the most trivial things. And yet
                does anyone
                who was there have any expectation those days will ever
                return? I
                doubt it. Surely everyone realizes that was just a
                temporary
                aberration.<br><br>The era of labor unions seems to have
                been the same kind of aberration,
                just spread
                over a longer period, and mixed together with a lot of
                ideology
                that prevents people from viewing it with as cold an eye
                as they
                would something like consulting during the
                Bubble.<br><br>Basically, unions were just
                Razorfish.<br><br>People who think the labor movement
                was the creation of heroic union
                organizers have a problem to explain: why are unions
                shrinking now?
                The best they can do is fall back on the default
                explanation of
                people living in fallen civilizations. Our ancestors
                were giants.
                The workers of the early twentieth century must have had
                a moral
                courage that's lacking today.<br><br>In fact there's a
                simpler explanation. The early twentieth century
                was just a fast-growing startup overpaying for
                infrastructure. And
                we in the present are not a fallen people, who have
                abandoned
                whatever mysterious high-minded principles produced the
                high-paying
                union job. We simply live in a time when the
                fast-growing companies
                overspend on different things.<br><br></article>
